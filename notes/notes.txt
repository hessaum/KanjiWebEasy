TODO ::

Add footer
Make that you can press a button to see even more example sentences
	Maybe load 30 at max in the data.py but only display 10 unless user presses button
Put analytics?
Make sufficiently solved readings appear on kanji page
Make a crowd-source sentence translator
Fix the following issue and more with n-grams:
	Can't tell some words are often related. i.e. オバマ　and 大統領 are usually beside each other
    Things like 吸わ are listed as separate readings also (comes from 吸わない) so this has to do with the backend code
