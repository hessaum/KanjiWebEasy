<p>Most Japanese websites use the same core database for their information from kanji readings to example sentences. The point of this website is to build a new database with more detailed and (constantly) updated information. This is done by crawling <a class="link" href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/">NHK Web Easy</a> articles, and so we recommend you check out their articles daily to support them. The suggested use for this website is as a supplementary to your regular studies and features no translations for the acquired material from the NHK. However, we hope to one day be your dictionary of choice.</p>
