<p>Most Japanese websites use the same core database for their information from kanji readings to example sentences.<br />
The point of this website is to build a new database with more detailed and (constantly) updated information.<br />
This information should help users read <a class="link" href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/">NHK Web Easy</a> articles.<br />
The website content is generated by crawling those articles, so please read their articles and support them!<br />
This website does not come with translations. This means you should use plugins like <a class="link" href="http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan/">Rikai-chan</a> or <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en">Rikai-kun</a> for translating words.<br />
