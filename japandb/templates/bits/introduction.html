<p>Most Japanese websites use the same core database for their information from kanji readings to example setences. The point of this website is to build a new database with more detailed and (constantly) updated information. This is done by crawling NHK Web Easy articles, and so we recommend you check out their articles daily to support them. The suggested use for this website is as a supplementary to your regular studies and features no translations for the aquired material from the NHK. However, we hope to one day be your dictionary of choice.</p>
